            <p>Here are the methods used for left, right and center placement in paragraphs.
            There are also inline methods for placement.In this paragraph the alignment attribute of the image is set to float:left.When the float left property is chosen text will flow to the right of the image.If it is a large image, ensuing paragraphs and elements like h1-h6 will also flow to the right of the image.We prevented that from happening on this page by placing a the following code after the desired amount of text that we wanted beside of the image.</p>
